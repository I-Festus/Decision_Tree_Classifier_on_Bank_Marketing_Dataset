## Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset  
This repository contains a Python implementation of a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. The project uses the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to the Bank Marketing Dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset contains real-world marketing campaign data, making it ideal for exploring classification algorithms like Decision Trees.

The decision tree classifier is implemented using Python, with a focus on preprocessing data, training the model, and visualizing its decision-making process. This project demonstrates the practical use of machine learning to aid in decision-making for marketing campaigns.

## Objectives
- Predictive Modeling: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product (yes or no) based on the provided features.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and encode the dataset to handle categorical variables, missing values, and ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Train the decision tree classifier using scikit-learn, evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix, and fine-tune its parameters.
- Visualization: Visualize the structure of the decision tree to interpret how decisions are made based on input features.
- Actionable Insights: Derive insights from the model to help businesses identify key customer traits influencing product subscription, improving marketing strategies.

## Features:
- Data preprocessing and encoding of categorical variables.
- Training and evaluation of a decision tree classifier using scikit-learn.
- Model evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Visualization of the decision tree structure.
